The goal of this project is to use existing data sources to analyze childcare cost, availibility and shortcomings in California.
Analysis will be conducted while learning data science and python. 
When starting this project, I had never coded in python or done any type of data analysis project.

What I've learned:
learned about the different data science environments available for data analysis such as Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda, and Datalore;
learned about the different types of data analysis libraries - matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, dash;
learned how to find and read documentation on the libraries; 
learned about using python to manipulate a dataframe and create data visualization; 
  how to import libraries;
  how to import data from a csv and create a dataframe;
  how to join together datasets;
  how to strip unnecessary information;
  how to display the data on charts in a visualization; 
    learned how to use plotly and dash; 
    learned how to create graphs with input components such as a dropdown;
    learned how to launch the application on localhost;
      
 What I would like to continue to learn:
  I'd like to learn more about where to find useful datasets to manipulate;
  I'd like to learn how to scape data from the internet;
  I'd like to try out Kaggle's data science projects;
